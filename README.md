ARM Cortex-M0 task scheduler  
std=c99, cmsis's libraries are not ported to ANSI  
this repo version has reviewed all headers and files  
and stuff etc., i.e. every file that's here has to be here  
for cortex-m0 project @ stm32f091rc w/ st-link v2  
and imo its the best possible location for it  
  
Todo:  
distinguish st files from mine
